    content: `I hold an MBA from Eastern Washington University and have spent over five years in e-commerce as a data analyst and account manager. This experience gives me a strong understanding of how good design supports business goals. Growing up, I was always interested in design and art. While studying at EWU, I worked at the student gallery, creating posters and postcards and helping to host events with local artists. At the time, I didnâ€™t consider design a serious career path. That changed in early 2023 when I began my journey at SAIT, which quickly sparked my passion for UX design. Since then, Iâ€™ve pivoted into this field and realized how much I love it. My goal is to keep growing as a designer and take on projects that make a real impact.`,

    title: "Design Philosophy",
    content: `With experience in both business and tech, I center my designs on real user needs, minimize cognitive load, and craft simple, intuitive interfaces. I believe every element on the screen should serve a clear purpose, guiding users smoothly toward their goals without distraction. Every feature must address a genuine pain point. By aligning user objectives with business goals, I create solutions that not only feel effortless but also deliver tangible value.`,
